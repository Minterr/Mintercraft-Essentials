# Mintercraft-Essentials
Mintercraft essentials plugin code - Eclipse-pushed


This plugin is a plugin which I developed, initially for my server. But because of unforseen circumstances my server had to shut down so I have been developing this for the public. I do not expect this to be big as I have lots of issues to fix.

This plugin is made for small servers who may want a slightly less known version of Essentials. More things such as /msg and /home will be implemented at a later time but at the moment I am working on fixing errors which are already present within the plugin. A GitHub repository will be addes soon. Anyone who has any issues with the plugin is to message below or PM me.

COMMANDS

/kick <playername> /teleport <playername> /kill <playername> /gmc <playername> /gms <playername>

For the /kill, gms and gmc commands leave all the arguments empty if you want to use these commands on yourself and n ot another ingame player.

A /mce command will be added soon with all my contact information on :) Thanks for reading this And easter egg commands to find out about!
